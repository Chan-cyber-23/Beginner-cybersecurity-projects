# Log Analysis - Beginner Project

This is a simple Python script that analyzes login data from a CSV file and counts the number of failed login attempts.

## Files Included
- `logins.csv` — Sample login log file
- `analyze_log.py` — Python script for analyzing the logs

## How It Works
The script reads the CSV file, checks the `status` column, and counts how many times "failed" appears.
